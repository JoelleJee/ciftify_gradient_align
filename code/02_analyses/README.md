## merging gradients
Gradients from day1 and day2 were merged according to their gradient number 
(i.e. all gradient 1's from day1 are merged together, all gradients 1's from day 2 are merged together, ...).

## correlation analyses
Merged Gradients were correlated (day1 vs day2) to see if individual gradients are unique to themselves.\
They were also correlated to the average gradients before and after Procrustes alignment to test the accuracy of the alignment.\

## plots
The produced plots can be found under ciftify_gradient_align/plots folder
